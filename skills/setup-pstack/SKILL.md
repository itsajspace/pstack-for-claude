# Setup pstack

Write `~/.claude/rules/pstack-models.md`, an always-applied rule that sets pstack's model per role.

## Steps

### 1. Detect available models

Enumerate the model values you can pass to an `Agent` subagent in this session: the aliases `opus`, `sonnet`, and `haiku`, plus any full model ID (such as `claude-opus-5-5`) the `/model` picker lists. That is the dependable source. If Claude Code also exposes a models list for the user's account, prefer it for completeness. If you cannot detect any, ask the user to paste the slugs they have access to. Never write a real slug you have not confirmed is available. The aliases `inherit-parent` and `auto` are always valid even though they are not detected slugs.

### 2. Load current state

The default role-to-model mapping is the rule shape shown in step 5 below. If `~/.claude/rules/pstack-models.md` already exists, read it and treat its `# budget` line and its role values as the current choices. Otherwise start from those defaults. A line whose role is not in step 5, such as `how critics`, is from a retired role. Drop it.

### 3. Budget, map, and confirm

**(a) Ask for a budget.** Prefer AskUserQuestion over free text. Offer these four options with these exact labels, and name the current budget when the rule records one. With no rule, say that `large` matches the skill defaults.

- `unlimited — max reasoning`
- `large — xhigh reasoning`
- `medium — high reasoning`
- `small — medium reasoning`

**(b) Apply it.** Build the working table from the skill defaults, and on a re-run keep any role you changed by family, list, or alias (`inherit-parent`, `auto`). Claude Code model names carry no effort token, so the budget does not rewrite slugs. `unlimited`, `large`, `medium`, and `small` set the session effort level to `max`, `xhigh`, `high`, or `medium` on the ladder `max` > `xhigh` > `high` > `medium` > `low`, and step 5 writes it. Every subagent runs at that level, panel entries included. `inherit-parent` and `auto` do not change. So `large` keeps the defaults at `xhigh`, and `small` runs the same `opus` and `sonnet` defaults at `medium`.

**(c) Show the roles and confirm.** Show every role with its model, marking any real slug not in the detected set as needing a choice. Also list each line step 2 dropped. Ask whether to accept as-is or change specific roles, offering the detected models plus `inherit-parent` and `auto` (both mean: this role runs on the parent chat model, which is how Auto users stay on Auto) as the options. Prefer AskUserQuestion over free text. For panel roles (arena runners, architect runners, interrogate reviewers) the value is a list, and one subagent runs per entry, alias entries included, so the list length sets the count. `arena cross-judge pool` is also a list, but Arena selects one value from it whose model family differs from the parent's when possible. `swarm workers` is the default model for every worker unless a race or comparison assigns another model per arm.

### 4. Validate

Every real slug written must be in the detected set. `inherit-parent` and `auto` always pass. If a chosen real slug is not available, stop and ask again.

### 5. Write the rule

Write `~/.claude/rules/pstack-models.md`, a user-level rule with no `paths` field so Claude Code loads it in every session, with a `# budget` line with the chosen label and its target effort, and one line per role, using the same labels poteto-mode uses. Overwrite the whole file so re-runs stay idempotent. Shape:

```
# pstack model configuration (overrides skill defaults). One line per role. Delete a line to fall back to the skill default.
# `inherit-parent` or `auto` as a value: the role runs on the parent chat model (omit Agent `model`). Alias entries in a panel list still count toward its fan-out.
# budget: large (xhigh)

reflect judgment, divergent, synthesizer: opus
arena runners: opus, sonnet
arena cross-judge pool: opus, sonnet
swarm workers: sonnet
architect runners: opus, sonnet
interrogate reviewers: opus, sonnet
```

Then apply the budget's effort level. Merge `"effortLevel": "<level>"` into `~/.claude/settings.json`, keeping every other key. That setting accepts `low`, `medium`, `high`, and `xhigh` but not `max`, so for `unlimited` write `xhigh` and tell the user to run `/effort max`.

### 6. Confirm

Tell the user the rule and the effort level were written and that they apply to new sessions. Re-running this skill updates it.

### 7. Offer a verification skill (optional)

Check whether the project has a way to drive the real app for proof (a `verify-*` skill, or an existing harness). If not, offer once: "want a project-local verification skill, so agents can drive the app the way a user does and prove changes work? I can generate one with /create-verification-skill." On yes, invoke `/create-verification-skill` (resolves wherever pstack is installed: workspace, user, or plugin). On no, move on without pushing.
